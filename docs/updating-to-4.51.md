title: Updating to 4.51
---

## Required Reading

The [etaHEN](https://github.com/LightningMods/etaHEN) jailbreak is only compatible with firmware versions from 3.00 to 4.51. As a result, older firmware versions must update manually in order to use the exploit.

While this guide focuses on updating to 4.51, this method will work for any firmware, as long as the target firmware version is above your current firmware version.

Note that you can only update to 4.51 if you are on firmware version 4.50 or below. If you are on firmware version 5.00 or above, this will not work.

We will ensure that the PS5 uses the update file we want by disabling network connectivity and deleting any pre-downloaded updates. It is also recommend to disable automatic updates to stop your PS5 from updating in the future without your permission.

## What you need

- A computer
- An exFAT or FAT32 formatted USB storage device with ~1,1GB of free space
- The `PS5UPDATE.PUP` file corresponding to the firmware version you are trying to update to
  - [<i class="fas fa-download"></i> PS5UPDATE.PUP](https://archive.org/download/ps5-official-firmwares/System%20Firmwares/Firmware%2004.51.00/PS5UPDATE.PUP) (4.51)
